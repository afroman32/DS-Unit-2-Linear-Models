    "We're going back to our other **New York City** real estate dataset. Instead of predicting apartment rents, you'll predict property sales prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not just for condos in Tribeca...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Use a subset of the data where `BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY` == `'01 ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS'` and the sale price was more than 100 thousand and less than 2 million.\n",
    "- [ ] Do train/test split. Use data from January — March 2019 to train. Use data from April 2019 to test.\n",
    "- [ ] Do one-hot encoding of categorical features.\n",
    "- [ ] Do feature selection with `SelectKBest`.\n",
    "- [ ] Fit a ridge regression model with multiple features. Use the `normalize=True` parameter (or do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) beforehand — use the scaler's `fit_transform` method with the train set, and the scaler's `transform` method with the test set)\n",
    "- [ ] Get mean absolute error for the test set.\n",
    "- [ ] As always, commit your notebook to your fork of the GitHub repo.\n",

    "\n",
    "- [ ] Add your own stretch goal(s) !\n",
    "- [ ] Instead of `Ridge`, try `LinearRegression`. Depending on how many features you select, your errors will probably blow up! 💥\n",
